# GulpForPulginTutorial
My code for gulp V4 related to the tutorials on making plug-ins by Alessandro Castellani(Here is his Youtube channel Below)
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmBY_XYZqCa2G0XmFA7ZWg
He starts using glup at part 19. 
I included three files related gulp on this and this plug in tutorial.
I'm not sure if you need the package-lock.json file or not. 
Also, gulp watch I have it as gulp w.  
Shortly after Alessandro start using gulp in his plug-in tutorials and he created the gulp tutorials gulp was updated to version 4 which had lots of changes from version 3.
These files are from what I have learned from the gulp tutorials, from comments on those tutorials, and my on trial and error. 
I encourage everyone to donate something to Alessandro Castellani, I have because he has such a great personality and skills.
I would hate to lose his expertise from the Internet.
