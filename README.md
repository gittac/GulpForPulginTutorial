# GulpForPulginTutorial
My code for gulp related to the tutorials on making plug-ins by Alessandro Castellani. He starts using glup at part 19. 
I included three files related gulp on this and this plug in tutorial.  I'm not sure if you need the package-lock.json file or not. 
Also, gulp watch I have it as gulp w.
